# AOC2021

Everything old is new again! I haven't really used [Ruby] for about 10 years but
I'm starting a new job where it is heavily used. So to refresh my Ruby
colored brain cells I'm going to try to keep up with the [Advent of Code 2021].

Also, I'm trying to get a better feel for using [TypeScript] so I'm going to try to do the exercises using that as well.
