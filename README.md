# AOC2021

Everything old is new again! I haven't really used [Ruby] for about 10 years but
I'm starting a new job where it is heavily used. So to refresh my Ruby
colored brain cells I'm going to try to keep up with the [Advent of Code 2021].

Update 1: I'm also trying to get a better feel for [TypeScript] so I'm going to give that a go as well.

Update 2: Things got a bit hairy around day 5 so I'm switching to alternative days for Ruby and TypeScript, it was too much to try to do both simultaneously.

Update 3: Dang, these are getting hard, I'm not sure I'm going to do every day so I can actually enjoy the holidays. Less nerd points for me.
